Name: Harlee Horng 

Student Number: s3717748

Email Address: Harlee_horng1999@hotmail.com 

My name is Harlee Horng, born in Australia in the year of 1999. My nationality is Cambodian as both of my parents are from there. When I was younger, my parents were firm believers of the Buddhism religion, therefore, so was my older sister and me. We would attend events held at the temple on occasions, including the major Chinese New Year festival which took place annually. By the age of 8, I was able to speak the Cambodian language (Khmer) fluently, but the ability to speak it faded away as I grew up and now, I am only able to understand it. Growing up, my family consisted of my mum, dad, sister and me. This changed in the year of 2014, when my dad remarried. A year after the marriage, a little stepsister joined our family who is currently 4 years old and currently attending kindergarten. I had a standard education like most other people, consisting of; kindergarten, primary school, high school and now currently studying at university. I graduated in the year of 2017 with a low ATAR, which required me to complete a year of a diploma course before transferring to a bachelors degree at RMIT. I acquired my first job at Maccas whilst I was in year 12 and I am still working there right now. As soon as I had enough money to afford a decent computer, I spent all my savings that I had at the time to build my computer. My hobby is playing video games on my PC. One specific game that I enjoy the most is ‘League of Legends’ which I have played consistently and constantly for 6 years.

An interesting fact about me is that I got detention on my first week of primary school because I chased other students around with a stick. Oddly enough, my personality has shifted drastically from when I was a child to now. I used to be confident and outgoing, contrasted to how I am now - which is quiet, introverted and anti-social.


### Interest in IT

Information technology has always been intriguing to me even as a child due to my passion of playing games.  I currently have little to no IT experience as the only IT related lesson I’ve undertaken was in year 10 of high school as an elective. I believe that the tv show “The IT Crowd” made a career in IT seem interesting, as it appeared as what my ideal job would look like.

The main reason why I chose to come to RMIT was because many of my cousins had gone to RMIT in the past or are currently studying here and recommended that it was a great university to study at. Also, with RMIT located in the city, it is a change of pace from my previous learning institutions of primary and high school. Thus, it makes for an exciting new experience of travelling to the city on a weekly basis for school via train. 

During my studies at RMIT university, I expect to acquire knowledge, skills and qualifications in the I.T field in order to prepare myself for a future career within the field of I.T. I believe that over the course of my studies, I will also learn other skills, such as; communication, decision-making, problem-solving, teamwork and time management skills.

![Job](https://github.com/hharlee/ProfileHarlee/blob/master/1step.png)

The advertised IT job involves working in a team environment and collaborating with different departments of the business, assisting with any issues regarding IT. This involves; managing and attending to tickets daily and performing all assigned tasks, responding to all phone calls, tickets and or emails received and providing excellent customer service in a fast and efficient manner. The working hours of this I.T support job is from 8:30am to 5pm for a total of 5 days a week from Monday to Friday. Three days of which will be at a customer site, while the other two days will be spent in the office. This is appealing to me as it allows for a variety of work in different spaces with reasonable hours. The advertisement does not explicitly display the salary rate for the job; however, similar jobs offer a pay of approximately 50k a year. 1step communication’s Melbourne support centre is in Port Melbourne, which is 40 minutes away from the CBD.

The requirements of this position in terms of skills, qualifications and experiences include having; 1 to 3 years of prior experience working on a help desk, a completed or nearly completed course relating to IT, a strong understanding of the operating systems and other computer knowledge and effective communication skills.

The skills, qualifications and experience I currently have including; being able to cooperatively work in a team, remaining calm under pressure, basic communication skills, basic computer skills and completion of high school. While working at my current place of employment – McDonalds, it is crucial to be able to work together as a team and to use communication effective to successfully and efficiently complete all tasks at hand. Additionally, the store may become extremely busy at any time of the day, which requires the ability to remain level-headed and to persevere through the constant orders. I also have decent computer skills of using software such as; Microsoft word, excel, presentation, etc. 

Due to the specifications of the IT job requiring prior knowledge of help desk jobs, I’d have to start off with an IT job which requires no prior experience or perhaps apply as an intern to an IT job. In regard to needing a course degree, I am currently working towards it as I am in my first year of studying a bachelors degree of information technology at the moment, which would result in acquiring a strong understanding of computers and its operations. Along with learning the contents of the course, I believe that throughout the course, I’d be able to develop my communication skills to be able to communicate effectively to customers in my future career.

The results of these tests show that I am introverted and prefer to work independently. They convey that I take a more observant approach to group work and participation with low levels of openness.  I believe that because I am more inclined to agree with people, it would cause less disruption and arguments in a team. As a result, I feel that I would be a good group member in terms of doing my part of the project. Regarding forming a team, I think it would be best to group up with people with the same or similar attributes as I have.
